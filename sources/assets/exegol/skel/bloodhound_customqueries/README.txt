If you wish to have your own "Bloodhound customqueries.json" file, you are at the right place.

Two possibilities:
1/ either you _replace_ Exegol's default provided file,
2/ or you _merge_ your own queries with Exegol's.

To do so, just place your valid BloodHound customqueries.json files either in the folder "replacement" or "merge".
The filenames do not matter as long as they have the .json extension.

Remark:
Should you have files in both folders, only the end result of "replacement" will be kept.
