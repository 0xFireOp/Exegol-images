# This script will be executed on the first startup of each new container with the my-resources feature enabled.
# You can add here any customization procedure (dependency installation, copy exotic configuration file, etc).
# However, it is advised **not** to overwrite the configuration files provided by exegol, otherwise you will not receive official updates (e.g. /root/.zshrc, /opt/.exegol_aliases).
# Alternatives exist to allow you to add your own customization without overwriting the official version of Exegol (refer to /exegol/supported_user_configs.md to learn more about user-friendly alternatives)
